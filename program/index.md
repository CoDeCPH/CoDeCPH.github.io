## DevOps, Cloud and Your SDLC
{: #devops}

#### Keynote

######[Andi Mann](/speakers#andimann), CA

By enabling new approaches to service delivery, cloud and DevOps together are delivering even greater speed, agility, and efficiency. No wonder leading innovators are adopting DevOps and cloud together!
This presentation will explore the synergies in these two approaches, with practical tips, techniques, research data, war stories, case studies, and recommendations.

Whether you are a startup or an enterprise; using private cloud, public cloud, or no cloud; an Agile noob or a DevOps pro; struggling with core banking systems, or building a new social/local/mobile app that will change the world (!); this session will give you actionable ideas on using cloud and DevOps together to revolutionize your software and service delivery lifecycle.

## Using Continuous Delivery to Build Products Customers Actually Use
{: #usingcd}

#### Keynote

######[Jan Bosch](/speakers#jbosch), Chalmers University of Technology

Research shows that for a typical system, more than half of all the features are never used. This is a colossal waste of R&D effort and is caused by companies asking customers and users what they want. Users don't know what they want and it's the engineer's job to find out. The presentation shows how Continuous Delivery can address this challenge by providing a systematic approach to exploring a broad set of hypotheses about functionality that might add value for users at different stages of development. The presentation introduces the notion of Innovation Experiment Systems as a systematic method for optimizing the user experience of existing features, developing new features as well as developing new products. Continuous Delivery is discussed as it provides the core enabling technology for successfully implementing this approach. The presentation is based on data from eight industrial cases and stresses the importance of speed and rapid iterations in development. The presentation uses numerous examples from industry are used to illustrate the concepts.

## How to find & grow your own DevOps experts…
{: #howto}

######[Paul Speers](/speakers#pspeers), Speerhead

The contractor market is booming for talented DevOps architects and engineers, salaries are rising. Finding and luring DevOps gurus to work on exciting truly transformation projects and creating and sustaining culture is highly challenging. Paul argues this is not a sustainable market dynamic with no real & proper training for new talent or existing IT engineers into the DevOps market.

In this session Paul discusses how can you grow the new breed of DevOps graduates, coders. How to do this, what methods to use, how to select talent from your current team and why you need to create a new IT world and sustain a DevOps culture. He maintains companies need help in on boarding new talent putting them through ‘on the job’ training covering not just coding but soft skills, meeting skills, IT automation, Open Source tooling and business process engineering.

## Continuous Delivery Maturity
{: #cdmaturity}

######[Lars Kruse](/speakers#lkruse), Praqma

For most software development teams it is a major challenge keeping up with the rapidly changing requirements, while delivering quality software within budget and deadlines. Implementing Agile or Lean methods is a step in the right direction, but many teams find out that this doesn't really solve the problems. This presentation give a comprehensive introduction to the multifaceted landscape of Continuous Delivery, argue why it is an important part of the solution, and present some successful real-life implementations of a full Continuous Delivery automation. Based on Praqma's CD maturity model the presentation will demonstrate how the ability to continuously deliver working software requires a certain level of maturity in software development processes.

## The implementation of Continuous Delivery at Ziggo (UPC-Liberty Global)
{: #cdziggo}

######[Michiel Sens](/speakers#msens), Xebia

The new Ziggo.nl website was launched in April 2014 and was developed by multiple vendors, comprising many different technologies like Java, PHP, Hippo CMS and MySql. As the site was build from the ground up, Ziggo automated the complete software delivery process and managed to deliver faster, cheaper and better than ever before.

This presentation explains the key ingredients to making this project a real success, the project structure that was applied, an overview of the tooling that was implemented, provides examples on how these tools were implemented and explains the main differences between a traditional software delivery process and the optimized software delivery process that can be used for Continuous Delivery.

## DevOps At Scale
{: #scale}

######[Benjamin Wootton](/speakers#bwootton), Contino

DevOps started life in ‘born on the web’ digital companies such as Facebook, Google, and Etsy.  As the movement has grown in size and prominence however, people are increasingly asking whether DevOps like practices can scale into bigger companies and how to get started on their own DevOps transformation.  

In this session, we will cover why DevOps is especially relevant in an Enterprise setting, covering some of the challenges how to overcome them.  We’ll bring this to life with examples from some of our clients, many of whom are already leveraging DevOps practices to get to market earlier and deliver better software, more efficiently.

## Implementing Continuous Delivery in practice for embedded devices
{: #embedded}

######[Jonas Bang Christensen](/speakers#bang), Schneider Electric & [Rasmus Voss](/speakers#voss), VossCon

A case story based on the experiences made from implementing Continuous Integration & Delivery at Nokia, and latest from an ongoing implementation at Schneider Electric. The presentation will take you through some of the challenges of how to convert the abundance of theories, concepts, and tools of Continuous Integration & Delivery, and in practice how to implement these into legacy embedded device projects using C, .Net, Java, and silverlight.

The speakers will share their views and advice on how to tackle change management, how to convince management of the importance of Continuous Integration & Delivery, which tools to use, where to begin, and what exactly is the difference between having and using version control.
The presentation will be concrete, but subjective, so consider yourself warned.

## Continuous Delivery X-rayed
{: #xrayed}

######[Lars Bendix](/speakers#bendix), Lund University

How does Continuous Delivery (and DevOps) look like from "the Ivory Tower" (the academic point of view)? A lightning analysis of why you might want to use Continuous Delivery and what you should probably look out for if you want to succeed. Spiffed up with some practical experience (aka Lessons Learned) from student projects - that might or might not relate to "the real world".

## Robust functional- and integration testing earlier in the SDLC is mandatory when introducing Continues Delivery (In Danish)
{: #sdlc}

######[Allan Tange](/speakers#tange), Testhuset

As the adoption of agile development and Continues Delivery increases, outcome like volume and frequents of releases put pressure on test and quality organizations. In order to address that, a more robust functional- and integration testing earlier in the SDLC is mandatory. However to accommodate that, production-like test environments are often needed and typically comes with a high cost. Occasional it is even impossible due to third party limitations.

This session will explain how the concept of Service Virtualization and automated testing is an enabler for improving the  quality of Software applications in a Continues Delivery life cycle.
