## DevOps, Cloud and Your SDLC
{: #devops}

#### Keynote

######[Andi Mann](/speakers#andimann), CA

By enabling new approaches to service delivery, cloud and DevOps together are delivering even greater speed, agility, and efficiency. No wonder leading innovators are adopting DevOps and cloud together!
This presentation will explore the synergies in these two approaches, with practical tips, techniques, research data, war stories, case studies, and recommendations.

Whether you are a startup or an enterprise; using private cloud, public cloud, or no cloud; an Agile noob or a DevOps pro; struggling with core banking systems, or building a new social/local/mobile app that will change the world (!); this session will give you actionable ideas on using cloud and DevOps together to revolutionize your software and service delivery lifecycle.

## Using Continuous Delivery to Build Products Customers Actually Use
{: #usingcd}

#### Keynote

######[Jan Bosch](/speakers#jbosch), Chalmers University of Technology

Research shows that for a typical system, more than half of all the features are never used. This is a colossal waste of R&D effort and is caused by companies asking customers and users what they want. Users don't know what they want and it's the engineer's job to find out. The presentation shows how Continuous Delivery can address this challenge by providing a systematic approach to exploring a broad set of hypotheses about functionality that might add value for users at different stages of development. The presentation introduces the notion of Innovation Experiment Systems as a systematic method for optimizing the user experience of existing features, developing new features as well as developing new products. Continuous Delivery is discussed as it provides the core enabling technology for successfully implementing this approach. The presentation is based on data from eight industrial cases and stresses the importance of speed and rapid iterations in development. The presentation uses numerous examples from industry are used to illustrate the concepts.

## How to find & grow your own DevOps experts…
{: #howto}

######[Paul Speers](/speakers#pspeers), Speerhead

The contractor market is booming for talented DevOps architects and engineers, salaries are rising. Finding and luring DevOps gurus to work on exciting truly transformation projects and creating and sustaining culture is highly challenging. Paul argues this is not a sustainable market dynamic with no real & proper training for new talent or existing IT engineers into the DevOps market.

In this session Paul discusses how can you grow the new breed of DevOps graduates, coders. How to do this, what methods to use, how to select talent from your current team and why you need to create a new IT world and sustain a DevOps culture. He maintains companies need help in on boarding new talent putting them through ‘on the job’ training covering not just coding but soft skills, meeting skills, IT automation, Open Source tooling and business process engineering.

## Continuous Delivery Maturity
{: #cdmaturity}

######[Lars Kruse](/speakers#lkruse), Praqma

For most software development teams it is a major challenge keeping up with the rapidly changing requirements, while delivering quality software within budget and deadlines. Implementing Agile or Lean methods is a step in the right direction, but many teams find out that this doesn't really solve the problems. This presentation give a comprehensive introduction to the multifaceted landscape of Continuous Delivery, argue why it is an important part of the solution, and present some successful real-life implementations of a full Continuous Delivery automation. Based on Praqma's CD maturity model the presentation will demonstrate how the ability to continuously deliver working software requires a certain level of maturity in software development processes.

## The implementation of Continuous Delivery at Ziggo (UPC-Liberty Global)
{: #cdziggo}

######[Michiel Sens](/speakers#msens), Xebia

Ziggo is one of the largest cable providers in the Netherlands and provides 3 million+ households with digital Television, Broadband Internet and/or Telephony. A new Ziggo.nl website was launched in April 2014 and is created by multiple vendors, comprising many different technologies like Java, PHP, MySql and Hippo CMS. As the site was build from the ground up, Ziggo took the opportunity to apply Continuous Delivery techniques to speed up the delivery process. This presentation explains the differences between a traditional and an optimised Software Delivery process, explains the key ingredients to making this project a success and provides an overview of components that were used to make the official Ziggo.nl launch a very dull but also very successful event.
